This project includes three main Colab notebooks. It's a good repository to start learning. The first repository explains some Python libraries and provides small examples. The second notebook extracts and graphs the properties of the audio.wav file in the vc file using librosa and similar library functions. In the third colab file, I cloned my own voice using the coquiai xtts model. If you'd like to use this repository, you can copy the link I provided: https://github.com/TalatDemir/Voice-project.git
